# CryptoApp
Crypto Tracker App
Overview
This is a test project for a Crypto Tracker App that allows users to track live cryptocurrency prices, view detailed information about coins, and manage a mock portfolio. The app integrates with the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time market data and uses RxSwift for reactive programming.

Features
1. Welcome Screen (Screen 01)
Displays an introduction screen with the app name and tagline.

Includes a "Get Started" button to navigate to the main screen.

2. Crypto List Screen (Market Overview and Portfolio) (Screen 02)
Displays live cryptocurrency prices fetched from the CoinGecko API, including:

Coin name, symbol, price, and 24-hour percentage change.

Market cap and volume.

Shows a mock portfolio with:

Total balance and monthly performance chart.

Portfolio allocation by coin (mock data).

Implements RxSwift for real-time market updates.

Includes pull-to-refresh functionality to refresh data.

3. Search Functionality (Optional)
Implements a search bar to filter cryptocurrencies by name.

Uses RxSwiftâ€™s debounce operator to optimize API calls.

4. Coin Details Screen (Screen 03)
Displays detailed information for each cryptocurrency using the CoinGecko API, including:

Coin name, price, market cap, and volume.

Seven-day price chart using historical data from the API.

Favorite button to save coins locally (mock implementation).

API Integration
The app integrates with the CoinGecko API to fetch:

Live cryptocurrency prices.

Historical data for price charts.

Coin details (name, symbol, market cap, volume, etc.).

Note: If certain fields are not available in the API, mock data is used as a fallback.

Technologies Used
RxSwift: For reactive programming and real-time updates.

Alamofire: For API requests and handling network calls.

SwiftUI: For building the user interface (if applicable).

Combine: For managing state and data flow (if applicable).

CoinGecko API: For fetching cryptocurrency data.

Mock Data
Portfolio Data: Mock data is used to display the portfolio balance, monthly performance chart, and allocation by coin.

Favorite Coins: Locally saved mock data is used to manage favorite coins.

Future Improvements
Implement user authentication and a backend to store portfolio and favorite coins.

Add more advanced charting features using a library like Charts.

Integrate push notifications for price alerts.
